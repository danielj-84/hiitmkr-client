            There's a lot more to high intensity interval training than its name
            alone suggests. In fact, HIIT refers to a very specific and
            particular type of training—and it's possible to do interval
            training without actually doing a real HIIT workout. The hallmark of
            HIIT is repeated, extremely hard bouts of work interspersed with
            periods of recovery. During your work intervals, you’ll be
            challenging yourself nearly to your max, Noam Tamir, C.S.C.S.,
            founder and CEO of TS Fitness in New York City, tells SELF. It’s the
            opposite of going for a long, easy run where you ration your energy
            in order to sustain the activity for longer. And it’s a little
            different from what you probably have seen labeled as “HIIT” in
            gen-pop exercise classes, says Tamir. Most protocols called “HIIT”
            would actually be more accurately described as circuit training or
            interval training, he says. When your body is going all-out during
            true HIIT, it relies on your anaerobic pathways (breaking down
            glucose without oxygen) to produce the energy it needs to fuel you.
            This provides an immediate supply of energy, but the amount is very
            limited—which means the length of time you can sustain that max
            effort is quite short, says Tamir. In fact, in true HIIT, you’d
            likely limit your work intervals to about 20 seconds, he says. Then
            you’d give yourself ample recovery time, usually at about a 2:1 or
            3:1 ratio of rest to work. So if you were doing 20-second sprints,
            you’d rest for 40 seconds to one minute before beginning your next
            interval. (This is different from what many people call HIIT, where
            their work periods are way longer and rest periods much shorter,
            meaning they can’t go as all-out.) Recovering before the next
            interval is essential: Forcing your body to repeatedly acclimate
            between two very different states provides excellent cardio
            conditioning, Franci Cohen, M.S., personal trainer and exercise
            physiologist, tells SELF. “The rest periods are needed to prep the
            body and enable it to truly perform at its max during the
            high-intensity spurts,” she adds. As for how to determine whether
            you’re working at that near-max level? To help gauge whether you’re
            working hard enough, fitness pros use a rate of perceived exertion
            (RPE) scale that describes effort levels on a spectrum of 1 to 10,
            with 10 being an all-out,
            giving-it-everything-you-didn’t-think-you-had level of intensity.
            “Work intervals during a HIIT session should be at near maximum
            (e.g. 9),” Cohen says.
